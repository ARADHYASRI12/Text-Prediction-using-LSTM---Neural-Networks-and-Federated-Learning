# Text-Prediction-using-LSTM---Neural-Networks-and-Federated-Learning
• Architected an end-to-end privacy-preserving Federated Learning pipeline in Python and TensorFlow/Keras, deploying client-side LSTM models and implementing the weighted Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm.
• Achieved 87%+ global model accuracy on a held-out test set after just 50 training rounds, successfully building a robust predictive model while ensuring all sensitive user data remained fully decentralized and private.
